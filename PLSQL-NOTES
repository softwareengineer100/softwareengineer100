######### 3 types of blocks #########
  Anonymous blocks
    you don't save them
  procedures
    named objects containing SQL and PL/SQL in it. procedures don't have a return type
  functions
    just like procedures. difference is that functions must return value

######### outputs #########
1. SET SERVEROUTPUT ON
2. DBMS_OUTPUT

######### Variable types #########
1. Scalar: hold single value with one type. basic simple
  1.1.  CHAR (Max_length): string or text max 32,767 bytes. default value is 1 byte
  1.2. VARCHAR2 (max_length): extended type of char. variable length. if you assign 30 bits then it will be 30 bits. if data is 10 bits only 10 bits is allocated
  1.3 NUMBER(precision, scale): 
    precision can be between 1 and 38. 
    scale can be betwen -84 and 127
    NUMBER(3,2) means 3 digits and 2 decimal places
  1.4 BINARY_INTEGER = PLSINTEGER:
      range is between negative 2 billion and positive 2 billion
      faster in arithmetic operations and require less storage than numbers
  1.5 BINARY_FLOAT
    allocates 5 bytes of memory
    end with "f" char.
    for e.g. 2.07f
  1.6 BINARY_DOUBLE
    require 9 bytes in memory
    ends with "d" keyword
    larger precision than binary_float data type
    BINARY_DOUBLE and BINARY_FLOAT computations do not raise exceptions
  1.7 BOOLEAN: True, False, and NULL
    by default it is NULL. In other languages it is by default false
  1.8 DATE
    has the time of day and hour, minutes, seconds
    to get the current date, you should use sysdate or current_date functions
  1.9 TIMESTAMP
    extension of date time
    in addition to date, time it has milliseconds with the precision that we specify
  1.10 TIMESTAMP(p) WITH TIMEZONE
    extends timestamp data type including timezone
  1.11 TIMESTAMP(p) WITH LOCAL TIMEZONE
    stores time with database's timezone
    but when you query it, oracle returns it with the timezone of your session
  1.12 INTERVAL(p) YEAR TO MONTH
    stores and manipulates intervals of years and months
    can set precisions for number of digits in year section.
  1.13 INTERVAL(p) DAY TO SECOND
    stores and manipulates intervals of days, hours, minutes and seconds.
    precisions specify the number of digits in the specified time value.
    
2. Reference: pointers to storage location
3. Large Objects: pointers to other data items stored outside of tables such as images, files etc
4. Composite: collections or records. variables that can hold more than one value in it.
